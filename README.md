# Data-And-Visualization

In this project we were provided with large datasets. 
The first dataset was the airport dataset, where the airports ID was provided, the latitude and longitude of the airport and the country the airport is in. 
The second dataset was the flight data, where all flights were shown, both national and international, showing the country of origin and the target country and the weight of the flight. This weight was an indication of how frequent the specific flight was done. 

The project required a few different things to be done. Firstly, it required for only the national flights to be presented on the world map for only the UK, USA, China and Australia. This meant making a seperate network of only internal flights. This is found in the file Full Map Q1.
To do this, using python i seperated the national flights of these countries from the rest of the flight dataset. Then plotted the seperated dataset on the world map.
Furthermore, the project required for the degree distribution, Degree vs Betweeness distribution and Assortativity of the airports in the 4 specified countries. This data is found in the Centrality file.
Lastly, the project required me to find a way to plot the Core Community size. This is found in the file names, 'Core Periphery size'.
